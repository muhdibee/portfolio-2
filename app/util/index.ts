export const aboutMeDetail: string = "I’m a full-stack software engineer passionate about building scalable and efficient web applications. I specialize in crafting clean, maintainable code across both front-end and back-end technologies. On the front end, I work with modern frameworks like React and Next.js, while on the back end, I leverage Node.js, Nest.js, and databases to build robust APIs and services. I’m adaptable to different tech stacks and always eager to learn new tools. I thrive in collaborative environments, whether on-site or remote. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, problem-solving, or spending time outdoors. Feel free to check out my work!";
